# Online Voting System

This project is an implementation of an online voting system developed in C language. It was a mini project created as a part of our Computational Thinking project.

## Overview

The online voting system allows users to register, vote for candidates, and view election results. It utilizes file handling and data structures for managing user information securely.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Users can register by providing their details such as name, age, and address. The information is stored securely using file handling.

- **Voting System:** Registered users can vote for their preferred candidates. Each vote is securely recorded and stored in files.

- **Efficient Searching:** Binary search algorithm is implemented to efficiently search for voter names in the file, ensuring quick retrieval of voter information.

## Implementation Details

### File Handling

- **Structures:** We utilized C structures to represent user information, including name, age, and address. These structures are stored in files for efficient data management.

- **Binary Search Algorithm:** For searching voter names in the file, we implemented the binary search algorithm. This algorithm ensures fast retrieval of voter information with a time complexity of O(log n).

## Time Complexity Analysis

- **Binary Search:** The time complexity of the binary search algorithm used for searching voter names in the file is O(log n), where n is the number of voters.
